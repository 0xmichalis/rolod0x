## FAQ

### How is this different to etherscan private addresses?

- It works on any site, not just etherscan.
- That means you can have wallet addresses labelled across
  multiple networks.
- You never share

### How is this different to ENS?

Registering entries in ENS costs gas, and is public.

Labelling addresses in this extension is totally free and private.
