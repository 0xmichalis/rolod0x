## FAQ

### How is this different to etherscan private addresses?

- It works on any site, not just etherscan.
- That means you can have wallet addresses labelled across
  multiple networks.
- You don't share your labels with etherscan.

### How is this different to ENS?

Registering entries in ENS costs gas, is public, and does not automatically
change how addresses are displayed in webpages.

Labelling addresses in this extension is totally free and private.

### Why is it called rolod0x?

It's a combination of three ideas:

- A [rolodex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolodex) is a rotating
  file device which used to be a common way to store business contact
  information before the digital era.

- The word
  "[dox](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dox)" or
  "[d0x](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=d0x)" refers
  to (revealing of) personal information about people online.

- `0x` is [a prefix used to denote hexadecimal
  numbers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2670639/why-are-hexadecimal-numbers-prefixed-with-0x),
  and in particular it's used as a prefix for all Ethereum addresses.
