# Privacy Policy for rolod0x

**rolod0x will never share your personal data without your explicit
permission.**

In fact, at the moment it can't share your data in any way at all,
since it doesn't perform any communications with the network.  (See
[the security policy](../SECURITY.md) for the technical details.)

rolod0x handles the following data:

## Addresses and labels

The addresses and labels you provide in the settings dialog are stored
locally within an isolated storage area in the browser reserved for
the extension.  This data is only used by the extension purely to
replace those addresses on websites which rolod0x operates on.  The
replacement happens locally within your browser.

In the future, a strictly optional feature is planned for the
convenience of users who use multiple browsers, to [allow convenient
synchronisation of data][#6] between those browsers.  If this is
implemented, it will require the user to explicitly authorise this
synchronization.  Even if authorised by the user, rolod0x will ensure
that the synchronised data will remain strictly private.

## Other data

Currently there is no other data.  However it is planned to extend
rolod0x with some other settings which are not security-sensitive.

This file will be maintained to reflect any such changes, or any other
changes to this policy.
