# Privacy Policy

**rolod0x will never share your personal data without your explicit
permission.**

In fact, at the moment it can't share your data in any way at all,
since it doesn't perform any communications with the network.  (See
[the security policy](../SECURITY.md) for the technical details.)

## Data storage

rolod0x stores your settings and address book data locally within an
isolated storage area in the browser reserved for the extension.

If you want to see exactly what is being stored, you can view this raw
data by [going to the extension settings
page](user-guide.md#reopening) and selecting the `Manage` section.

### Addresses and labels

The addresses and labels you provide in the settings dialog are used
by the extension *purely* to replace those addresses on websites which
rolod0x operates on.  The replacement happens locally within your
browser.

In the future, a strictly optional feature is planned for the
convenience of users who use multiple browsers, to [allow convenient
synchronisation of data][#6] between those browsers.  If this is
implemented, it will require the user to explicitly authorise this
synchronization.  Even if authorised by the user, rolod0x will ensure
that the synchronised data will remain strictly private.

### Other data

Currently the only other data stored are:

- the colour theme
- [the two display formats](user-guide.md#display)

However it is planned to extend rolod0x with some other settings which
are not security-sensitive.

This file will be maintained to reflect any such changes, or any other
changes to this policy.
