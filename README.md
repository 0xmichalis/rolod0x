## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

<img src="./docs/images/phone-unknown-number-calling.png" align="right" width="200"
     alt="Smart phone with unknown number calling" />

Would you buy a phone which didn't have an address book feature?  Of course
not - that would be ridiculous!  You'd never know who was calling you, and
making phone calls would be painful.

What about a phone which had an address book but required you to publish all
the entries so that the whole world could see them?  Of course not - that
would be a massive privacy violation!

**So why accept anything less when using web3 and blockchains?**

Well, you don't have to any longer!  rolod0x is a free cross-browser
extension providing **a totally private web3 address book which instantly
makes every web3 website more usable and all your addresses more
accessible.**

For example, take:
[this randomly-picked transaction on etherscan][random-tx]:

![etherscan transaction without rolod0x](docs/images/etherscan-example-before.png)

After labelling the From and To addresses in rolod0x, it now looks like this:

![etherscan transaction with rolod0x](docs/images/etherscan-example-after.png)

Not only that, but whenever these addresses appear on _any other website_,
they will now be labelled in this human-readable way!

[random-tx]: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1e2a4312f7d48efd29ed5dbcca6cabae30214ea895ab54c9b789860cbe8d31dd

## Features <a name="features"></a>

  chains in the future).
- Should work on Chrome, Chromium, Brave, or any other browser in the Chrome family.
- _May_ work on Firefox - not yet tested, but planned (see https://github.com/aspiers/rolod0x/issues/19).

- Named using [a triple pun](./docs/FAQ.md#name).

## Thanks <a name="thanks"></a>

Thanks to all contributors.  Some special mentions:

- [`@fregante`](https://github.com/fregante/) for all his great npm modules,
  several of which are used by rolod0x.

- [`@jonghakseo`](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/) for
  <https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite> which was
  a great starting point for a React-based MV3 extension.

- The awesome team at my startup [Toucan](https://toucan.earth) for
  being early beta testers and encouraging me to keep working on this
  project.  In particular, thanks to [Alex Haase](https://twitter.com/herrhaase)
  for brainstorming with me and coming up with the perfect name!

This [Free Software license][free software] was chosen because its

### Why is there also a `LICENSE` file including the Expat ("MIT") license?

This extension is based on
<https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite/>
[released][boilerplate-license] under [the permissive Expat (a.k.a. MIT)
license][expat], and formerly on
<https://github.com/fregante/browser-extension-template/> which is [released
under CC0][fregante-license].

Relicensing to GPL is allowed because the permissive Expat license
explicitly allows sublicensing as long as [the original copyright
notice](./LICENSE) is preserved.
